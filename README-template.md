## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Progressive JS Framework

### What I learned

This was my first experience using **Vue JS** to build an app. I learned how to work with _templates_, _scoped styling_, pass props to _components_, and emit events. Fetching data from the API felt quite similar to using a hook in React, though the terminology is differentâ€”it's called a composable in Vue, not a hook.

This is how I handle the click event in a custom component:

```html
<button @click="$emit('click')">
  <img src="/images/icon-dice.svg" alt="dice" />
</button>
```

Using separate files for variables and setting font:

```scss
@import './_base.sass' @import './_variables.sass';
```

I've added a reload trigger by updating a ref value. Since the watchEffect will pick up the value change, it will call the same url again:

```js
import { ref, toValue, watchEffect } from 'vue'

export function useFetch<T>(url: string) {
  const data = ref<T | null>(null)
  const error = ref(null)
  const reloadTrigger = ref(0)

  function fetchData() {
    data.value = null
    error.value = null

    fetch(toValue(url))
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((json) => {
        data.value = json
      })
      .catch((err) => (error.value = err))
  }

  watchEffect(() => {
    if (reloadTrigger.value >= 0) fetchData()
  })

  function reload() {
    reloadTrigger.value++
  }

  return { data, error, reload }
}

```
